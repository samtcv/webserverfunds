The Beerlympics started off as just a weekend at my cottage with a bunch of my friends. After a few drinks with my friend Eric, we decided, we should create the beerlympics. It started off as just a 24 beers in 24 hour challenge, then we added games and points and a trophee. We had so many ideas, but not much time to plan it all. At the weekend, it went well, there were many things we could change. For the opening ceremonies we lit the campfire using a cigarette on the fire that had gasoline. There may no have been enough gasoline or my friend missed the gasoline with his cigarette, but it didn't end up working so maybe some changes to the ceremony or more prectice would fix that. The opeing ceremony fireworks also weren't as expected, however these are all things that can be improved on for next year and the weekend was still a blast and we playd many games and has lots of fun. In the first Olympics in the summer of 2024, Sonic brought home the trophee, stopping by the local ice cream shop to eat ice cream out of his hard earned new trophee.
